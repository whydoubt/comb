Comb
====

A Docker image for running [VOC's](https://github.com/beeware/voc) Python 3.7 tests on [BeeKeeper](https://github.com/beeware/beekeeper).

If your own testing needs don't match this base image, you can use it as a template for your own Docker image, which can be referenced in the BeeKeeper configuration file for your project.
